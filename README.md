14/01/2025 v1.0.0

code is from gpt prompt

make sure u pip intsall the dependancies

it doesnt take user input for the filters. that could be added, think it just adds them as a static variable so rn it may be searching for the ticker "ticker"

main function not working, i have limited experience with async not looked at it yet. could use dif method of calling prob.

the api and fetch/ filter stuff should work the rest is reletivley simple input handling and display.

error handling should work.

code comments are gpt not me

R
