code is from gpt prompt

make sure u pip intsall the dependancies

It doesnt take user input for the filters. That could be added, think it just adds them as a static variable so rn it may be searching for the ticker "ticker"

Main function not working, i have limited experience with async not looked at it yet. could use dif method of calling prob.

The api and fetch stuff should work the rest is reletivley simple input handling and display.

Error handling should work.

Comments are gpt not me
